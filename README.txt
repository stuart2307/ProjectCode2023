This is a Vehicle Marketplace System where users can:

1. Create accounts
2. View vehicle advertisements from other users
3. Place vehicle advertisements for other users to view
4. View other users account details including contact info (this allows them to arrange a sale)
5. Like and Dislike other user's accounts (this allows users to like trustworthy accounts and dislike untrustworthy dealers)

Created using Java & MySQL

(You may need to run the JAR file twice the first time you run the program)
This is because the code changes the database settings the first time to allow large file size images
